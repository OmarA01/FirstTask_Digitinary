I tried to implement an interface that will allow adding, removing, updating & listing (users, tasks, projects), plus executing tasks that belong to (specific user, project, main array of tasks) with the option to filter them by (status, priority, dueDate)

The project isnt complete, thats why i created a auto generated sample to give you an idea on how the system should behave in particular scenarios
